:hammer_and_wrench: I designed a personal website for my sister. She is a passionate hobby artist and I wanted to offer her a platform to showcase her works. The design of the website is deliberately kept simple, so that the artworks are in the foreground. However, at the same time I made sure that the site has a creative and appealing atmosphere that reflects her artistic personality.
